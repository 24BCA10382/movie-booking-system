# Movie Ticket Booking System in C

## Project Description
This is a simple Movie Ticket Booking System developed using the C programming language. The system allows users to view a list of available movies, choose a movie, select the number of tickets, and confirm their booking. It demonstrates the use of basic data structures like arrays and structures to manage and store data effectively.

## Features
- Display a list of available movies
- Select a movie to book tickets
- Choose number of tickets
- View booking confirmation with seat details

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to apply the concepts of data structures in C to a real-world application. It helps understand how arrays and structures can be used for storing, retrieving, and managing data in a programmatic way.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: C
- Compiler: GCC or any C compiler
- Platform: Terminal / Console-based Interface

## How to Run
1. Open your C compiler (Code::Blocks, DevC++, GCC, etc.)
2. Paste the code into a new file and save it as movie_booking.c
3. Compile and run the program
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to book your movie tickets

## Educational Purpose
This project is developed for academic purposes under the subject *Data Structures*, to practically implement the use of:
- Structures (struct)
- Arrays
- Functions
- Conditional and Looping Statements
